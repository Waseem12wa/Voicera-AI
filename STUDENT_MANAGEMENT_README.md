## üìä Sample Data

The system includes sample data with:
- 5 student users with realistic profiles
- 3 sample notifications (quiz assignments and announcements)

- Random online/offline status for testing

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/voicera
CLIENT_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173
PORT=4000
```

### WebSocket Configuration
The WebSocket server runs on the same port as the HTTP server (4000) and supports:
- CORS for frontend connections
- Room-based messaging (teacher-{email}, student-{email})
- Automatic student status updates

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm start
   ```

2. **Seed the database**:
   The database will automatically seed with sample data on first run.

3. **Test the API**:
   ```bash
   node test-student-api.js
   ```

4. **Access the frontend**:
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5173` and log in as a teacher or student.

## üìù Usage Examples

### Assigning a Quiz
1. Teacher logs in and goes to Enhanced Teacher Dashboard
2. Navigates to "Student Management" tab
3. Clicks "Assign to Students" on any quiz
4. Selects students from registered/active lists
5. Confirms assignment
6. Students receive instant notifications

### Student Receiving Notifications
1. Student logs in and goes to Student Dashboard
2. Navigates to "Notifications" tab
3. Sees new quiz assignment notification
4. Can view quiz details and mark as read
5. Real-time updates show new notifications instantly

### Student Taking Assigned Quizzes
1. Student logs in and goes to Student Dashboard
2. Navigates to "Quizzes" tab
3. Sees only quizzes assigned by teachers (not all available quizzes)
4. Each quiz shows assignment details (date assigned, due date, attempts, best score)
5. Can start/continue quizzes based on assignment status

- **Bulk Operations**: Assign multiple quizzes at once
- **Custom Notifications**: Teacher-created announcements
- **Notification Preferences**: Granular notification settings

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No students showing**: Ensure database is seeded with student data
2. **Notifications not appearing**: Check WebSocket connection and student email
3. **Assignment failing**: Verify quiz and student IDs exist
4. **Real-time not working**: Check WebSocket server is running
